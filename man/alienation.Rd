\description{
The data comes from research
on the stability of alienation using panel data.
The variables in the model were aggregated
from 932 individual responses
drawn from a rural region of Illinois
to a series of items from attitude scales
measured in two time points (1967 and 1971).
"Anomia" and "powerlessness" were both conceived
as indicators of the latent variable "alienation".
Background variables including "education",
and the socio-economic index score ("SEI")
were also measured in 1967
and were boh conceived as indicators
of the respondent's socio-economic status.
