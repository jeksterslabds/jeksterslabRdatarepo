#' Model of the Stability of Alienation
#'
#' The data comes from research
#' on the stability of alienation using panel data.
#' The variables in the model were aggregated
#' from 932 individual responses
#' drawn from a rural region of Illinois
#' to a series of items from attitude scales
#' measured in two time points (1967 and 1971).
#' "Anomia" and "powerlessness" were both conceived
#' as indicators of the latent variable "alienation".
#' Background variables including "education",
#' and the socio-economic index score ("SEI")
#' were also measured in 1967
#' and were boh conceived as indicators
#' of the respondent's socio-economic status.
#'
#' @format A 6 by 6 variance-covariance matrix
#' summarized from 932 respondent.
